The conceptualization of BCIs emerged from early neurophysiological investigations into brain electrical activity. Jacques Vidal’s seminal work in 1973 formally introduced the term “Brain-Computer Interface” and demonstrated the feasibility of direct brain-controlled communication systems. Prior to this, foundational studies during the 1960s focused on Electroencephalography (EEG) as a non-invasive method for recording neural oscillations related to cognitive and motor functions. These early explorations established baseline methodologies for capturing brain signals and interpreting them as potential control commands for external devices. Despite technological limitations at the time, such as low spatial resolution and signal-to-noise challenges, these initial efforts laid crucial groundwork for subsequent BCI research.

### 2.2 Advancements in Neural Signal Acquisition Technologies

Subsequent research has expanded beyond EEG to include other neuroimaging modalities that enhance spatial and temporal resolution of brain activity monitoring. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) represent key advancements by providing complementary insights into neural dynamics through magnetic field detection and hemodynamic responses, respectively. MEG offers superior spatial resolution compared to EEG while maintaining high temporal fidelity, though it requires expensive equipment and controlled environments. Conversely, fMRI excels in spatial localization but suffers from lower temporal resolution due to reliance on blood oxygenation level-dependent signals. The integration of high-density EEG arrays with wireless technology has improved portability and accessibility while maintaining acceptable signal quality for non-invasive applications. Collectively, these developments have expanded the repertoire of tools available for capturing neural signals pertinent to BCI functions.
